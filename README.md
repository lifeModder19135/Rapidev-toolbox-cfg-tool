# Rapidev-toolbox-cfg-tool

AUTHOR: ntolb / lifeModder19135

## _tl;dr.._



_`cfg-tool` 'will eventually be a package in the Rapidev toolbox that contains an assortment of tools for working with all types of config files.'_


## RAPIDEV MANIFESTO

My goal FOR Rapidev is to provide all of these tools in a single solution. Today, one of my issues as a developer is _too_ _many_ solutions. Or at least too many sources for solutions. I get distracted easily, so projects which require a lot of solution hunting on the web naturally take way too long too complete. What's worse, often they are never finished at all. This very account is quickly becoming a graveyard for abandoned hobby/personal projects where I started looking for a needed solution (maybe a parser, a translator, or something similar) and ended up finding a new project due to oooh-shiny-itis.


## FEWER TOOLS NEEDED WITH LARGE BUT UNIFORM TOOLS

I believe that a great remedy for this is to get as many uses as possible from as few tools as possible. This way I can learn the few well and so long as they each contain a somewhat uniform syntax & usage pattern. In a perfect case, if you know one usage, you know them all. obviously, life doesn't offer us too many perfect, or even ideal, cases. That said, I believe the best software comes from developers with a passion for getting their work a close to ideal as they can, so I strive to be one of those developers.  


## ABOUT `cfg-tool`

At the moment, it is still very early in the design phase. Most of the features are still ideas that I still haven't thought to think up, to put it eloquently. This section will be filled in once design plans are a bi more concrete. Current 'TODO' features are 
  - a config generator for making the boilerplate from..
  - a custom definition language, just for configs. I am sure this already exists; I might just borrow it.
  - a `**/.memory/` directory tree which will contain abstractions for long & short term memory 


## SMALLEST POSSIBLE...
not needed For now, needs to generate files based on simple (included, at first, anyway. maybe even hard-coded) yaml template. Afterward, I'll go from there.
